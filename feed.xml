Then I decided to write this article.</p> <p>The main ideas of this post are adopted from an article written by a famous Chinese blogger, MindHacks (刘未鹏) – <em>Why you should start blogging now</em>. <a href="#reference">[1]</a> In this article, he spotlighted how beneficial it could be to keep a <em>valuable blog</em> and successfully persuaded me to write my first blog many years ago.</p> <p>Now I want to write those reasons down and let this post serve as review of his article and a reminder to help me keep in mind <strong><em>why I started blogging</em></strong> and <strong><em>what I am blogging for</em></strong>. Hopefully, just as I was influenced by MindHacks, I also wish this post could probably inspire some of you to <strong><em>start your own journey of blogging</em></strong> and enjoy the goodies that it might bring you.</p> <h2 id="benefits-of-blogging">Benefits of Blogging</h2> <p>According to MindHacks,</p> <blockquote> <p>Blogging can bring <strong>numerous benefits</strong> but <strong>no obvious downsides</strong>. In other word, using the form of a blog to <strong>record your valuable thoughts</strong> can bring many benefits without any obvious downsides. [1]</p> </blockquote> <p>In this context, blogging is not expressing random musings, trivial mood notes, idle chatter, or filling the void with words, but a result or summary of your thinking. [1] With this being said, I think you might already have get some sense of how beneficial blogging could be.</p> <p>Here I want to list <strong><em>ten main advantages</em></strong> of maintaining a long-term valuable blog, combining my understandings and ideas from the original article. [1]</p> <h3 id="1-recording-valuable-thoughts">1. Recording valuable thoughts</h3> <p>Just writing down your thoughts is beneficial. Like sparkles, if you don’t record them right away, your thoughts will disappear very quickly. You are losing the wealth of your thoughts! Not to mention, old thoughts may inspire future creations.</p> <p>The valuable records can also help with review and reflection. By reading the words you wrote long time ago you can recall the situation and observe your progress. Witnessing the growth not only helps with the self-development but also serves as a source of fulfillment.</p> <p>Furthermore, taking notes down can also help you with problem solving. With a clear record, you don’t have to solve the same problem again in the future. Everytime I encounter the same problem (especially with certain complexity) that I’ve solved years ago but didn’t record properly, I regret that I didn’t write them down! It turns out to be a waste of time and a waste of life T_T</p> <h3 id="2-fostering-better-thinking">2. Fostering better thinking</h3> <p>Blogging is more than just putting your thoughts into words. It also requires maintaining them in a structured format. This process helps you arrange your ideas, enhance mental clarity, and encourage deeper reflection. It reveals hidden patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed, bringing to light areas of ambiguity or gaps.</p> <p>If you have ever written a thesis, paper, or report, you will recognize the value of organizing your thoughts systematically to form coherent arguments. Blogging is like a mini version of that process. It promotes logical reasoning, sharpens your ability to analyze, and strengthens critical thinking over time.</p> <h3 id="3-motivating-continuous-learning-and-thinking">3. Motivating continuous learning and thinking</h3> <p>One of the unexpected benefits of blogging is how it exposes the limits of your own understanding. As you try to articulate your ideas clearly, you often stumble upon gaps in knowledge or fuzzy logic. Rather than being discouraging, these moments spark curiosity and drive you to dig deeper.</p> <p>Blogging turns passive thoughts into active questions—encouraging you to research, reflect, and refine. The more you write, the more you realize how much there is to explore, and this ongoing cycle of expression and inquiry fuels a habit of lifelong learning. In this way, each post becomes not just a record of what you know, but a doorway to what you’re about to discover.</p> <h3 id="4-learning-to-keep-consistency">4. Learning to keep consistency</h3> <p>We are human. Staying consistent is hard. However, maintaining a blog, even at a slower pace, teaches the value of showing up over time. Whether you’re writing weekly, monthly, or just when inspiration strikes, the act of sticking with something positive creates momentum. It builds discipline, patience, and a quite sense of progress in the long run. And that kind of long-term commitment is definitely something that you can be proud of.</p> <p>Moreover, in the world of information exploration, knowledge often comes in scattered pieces, making patience essential. By consistently blogging, you learn to sift through and organize these fragmented insights, turning them into something meaningful. This practice helps you stay focused and disciplined as you navigate through vast amounts of information.</p> <h3 id="5-teaching-is-the-best-way-to-learn">5. Teaching is the best way to learn</h3> <p>Have you ever heard of the Feynman Technique? It’s a method that emphasizes the power of teaching as a learning tool — if you can explain a concept clearly and simply, it means you truly understand it. Blogging works in much the same way. When you try to communicate an idea to an audience that may not share your background or expertise, you’re forced to confront the fuzzy parts in your own understanding.</p> <p>Writing about complex topics in a way that others can grasp requires you to break things down, reframe them, and often revisit the basics. This process not only strengthens your grasp of the subject but also reveals any weak spots in your knowledge. In essence, teaching others through blogging reinforces your own understanding — often multiplying what you learn many times over.</p> <h3 id="6-enhancing-reusability-of-information">6. Enhancing reusability of information</h3> <p>Blogging significantly enhances the reusability of information, as Mindhacks wisely points out. The ability to create content that can be reused, shared, and referenced repeatedly is incredibly powerful. When you blog, you’re not simply capturing your thoughts for a one-time use — you’re creating content that can be accessed again and again. Once published, your ideas transcend time and location, becoming available to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>This means that rather than having to explain the same thing over and over, you can simply point others to your blog post. Over time, this reduces your workload and boosts your efficiency in sharing information. It’s like building a personal reference library that others can tap into, making learning and communication more streamlined and effective in the long run.</p> <h3 id="7-discussion-promotes-deeper-reflection">7. Discussion promotes deeper reflection</h3> <p>When you focus on a specific topic, you’re engaging with a targeted group of people who share an interest in that area. These readers may have questions — some you can easily answer, while others may challenge your understanding. This interaction encourages you to think more deeply, as you’re constantly re-evaluating and refining your thoughts.</p> <p>Additionally, you can learn a lot from your audience. They might point out mistakes you hadn’t noticed, offer helpful advice, or spark new ideas that hadn’t crossed your mind. Through this ongoing exchange, the discussion fosters not only a greater understanding of the subject but also enhances your own learning and growth.</p> <p>In this way, it’s a win-win situation for both you and your audience — while you gain new perspectives and refine your knowledge, your audience benefits from the insights you share, making it a dynamic and enriching process for everyone involved.</p> <h3 id="8-finding-like-minded-friends">8. Finding like-minded friends</h3> <p>Blogging connects people through shared values and thoughts. MindHacks touched on this idea too — it’s not just about broadcasting, it’s about creating a space where others who resonate with you can find you.</p> <p>Many people try to make friends online, but it’s often hard to find those who truly share your values—especially through shallow social media chatter. Blogging, on the other hand, naturally attracts like-minded individuals. When you share thoughtful content, you not only express your ideas but also invite deeper connection. Over time, a meaningful blog becomes a magnet for those who resonate with your beliefs.</p> <p>Moreover, unlike traditional friendships that start with small talk and take time to build, blogging breaks geographical barriers and lets your ideas speak for you — saving time and creating stronger, more authentic bonds.</p> <h3 id="9-a-resume-to-the-world">9. A “resume” to the world</h3> <p>As you connect with like-minded individuals, your blog not only fosters deeper relationships but also becomes a living resume, reflecting your values, beliefs, and professional identity.</p> <p>Unlike traditional resumes that list jobs and qualifications, blogging offers a window into who you are and what you care about, without having to repeatedly explain yourself. This openness invites meaningful connections and unexpected opportunities, as people who resonate with your ideas naturally gravitate toward you. In short, your blog quietly represents you to the world.</p> <h3 id="10-improving-writing-skills-and-extra">10. Improving writing skills and extra</h3> <p>Last but not least, though MindHacks didn’t mention, don’t forget: blogging helps you improve your writing. Writing is a skill that requires practice. The more you write, the faster you become, and the better the quality of your work. Blogging helps you learn to convey your ideas in a more logical and effective way, refining your ability to express yourself clearly.</p> <p>And if you’re writing in a foreign language, there’s an extra bonus — you’re not just improving your writing, but also practicing the language. Unlike boring writing exercises, blogging allows you to discuss topics you care about and express your thoughts in the new language you’re learning. Plus, nowadays, you can even use assistants like ChatGPT to help with your writing. In doing so, you may learn new phrases and expressions, which can enhance your vocabulary and improve your writing style.</p> <p><strong>OK! With so many benefits in mind, let’s start blogging! Wait… wait a minute, I’ve heard there are many stones in the way?</strong></p> <h2 id="get-stones-out-of-the-way">Get Stones out of the way</h2> <p>In the original Mindhacks article, he also listed some common stones — those familiar excuses we all know too well. Let’s name them and move them aside.</p> <p><strong>Stone 1: What if I don’t know what to write?</strong><br/> If you keep thinking and learning, questions will naturally come up. Just record your thoughts—it’s all part of the process.</p> <p><strong>Stone 2: What if my thoughts are naive or not valuable?</strong><br/> If it’s valuable to you, it can be valuable to someone like you. Don’t underestimate that.</p> <p><strong>Stone 3: What if I get something wrong and “real specialists” laugh at me?</strong><br/> Real specialists don’t attack people. And if someone does? They’re not worth your time — just walk away.</p> <p><strong>Stone 4: What if someone points out my mistake?</strong><br/> Congrats! You just learned faster. Stay open —- it’s how you grow.</p> <p><strong>Stone 5: What if I run out of ideas?</strong><br/> Ideas come from living, learning, and noticing. Keep feeding your mind and ideas will follow.</p> <p><strong>Stone 6: What if there’s no reward?</strong><br/> Sometimes, writing is the reward. Even with no audience, the clarity you gain is priceless.</p> <p><strong>Stone X: What if …</strong><br/> Move the stone aside and just do it.</p> <p>It’s always easier said than done —- but solutions exist: Learn, think, and record. Make a time schedue and build a habit. (Hint: <em>Atomic Habits</em> is a great guide.)</p> <p>Ready to go? I’d love to hear from you.
