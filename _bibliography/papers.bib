  abstract = {Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy has proven to provide deep insights into the optoelectronic properties of monolayer MoS2{\textbackslash}{\l}eft({\textbackslash}textMoS{\textbackslash}right)\_2{\textbackslash}. Herein, a corresponding study is conducted on the excitonic properties of mechanically exfoliated monolayer MoS2{\textbackslash}{\l}eft({\textbackslash}textMoS{\textbackslash}right)\_2{\textbackslash} under multivariate physical and chemical stimuli. Specifically, midgap exciton states that originate from lattice defects are characterized and they are compared to existing models. Through statistical data analyses of substrate-, temperature-, and laser-power-dependent measurements, a PL enhancement is revealed through physisorption of water molecules of the controversially discussed excited-state A biexciton (AXX*{\textbackslash}A{\textasciicircum}{\l}eft({\textbackslash}textXX{\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}). In addition, analyses of monolayer MoS2{\textbackslash}{\l}eft({\textbackslash}textMoS{\textbackslash}right)\_2{\textbackslash} on gold substrates show that surface roughness does not account for changes in doping level within the material. Also, a shift in the electron--phonon coupling properties that arises from thin films of water that are physisorbed on top of the samples is reported.},
