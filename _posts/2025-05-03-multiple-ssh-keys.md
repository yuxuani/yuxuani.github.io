If you're working with multiple GitHub accounts, you might want to keep your credentials separate for each account. This tutorial will show you how to use different SSH keys for two GitHub accounts (`account1` and `account2`) on the same machine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Generate SSH Keys for Both Accounts

First, generate SSH keys for each account. If you already have one key for `account1`, you'll generate a separate key for `account2`.

**Generate Key for Account 1:**  
If you haven‚Äôt done so already for `account1`, generate an SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email1@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1
```

Note:  
- `ssh-keygen` is used to generate an SSH key pair.
- `-t rsa`: Specifies using the RSA algorithm. `ecdsa` or `ed25519` are also options.
- `-b 4096`: Specifies the key length as 4096 bits for stronger encryption.
- `-C "your_email1@example.com"`: Adds a comment (email) for identification purposes.
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1`: Specifies the file where the private key will be saved.


**Generate Key for Account 2:**  
Similarly, generate a separate SSH key for account2:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email2@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account2
```
After creating these keys, make sure to add their corresponding public keys (id_rsa_account1.pub and id_rsa_account2.pub) to the respective GitHub account's SSH settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure SSH config File
Next, we‚Äôll configure the SSH settings to ensure that each account uses the correct key.

Open your terminal and edit the SSH config file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following configuration:

```
# Account 1 - Default GitHub account
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account1
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Account 2 - Second GitHub account
Host github-account2
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_account2
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Here:

`github.com` is for `account1` (default GitHub account).

`github-account2` is a custom alias for `account2`. This ensures the right SSH key is used.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step 3: Clone Repositories Using the Correct Account
When cloning a repository, make sure you use the correct alias for the second account.


```bash
# Clone with Account 1 (default):
git clone git@github.com:account1/repo-name.git
```
```bash
# Clone with Account 2:
git clone git@github-account2:account2/repo-name.git
```
Note: Use `github-account2` as the host to ensure that `account2`'s SSH key (`id_rsa_account2`) is used.

## üìù Step 4: Set Git Configuration for Each Repository (Optional)
To make sure you‚Äôre committing with the correct user for each project, set the `user.name` and `user.email` for each repo.

For Account 1:
```bash
git config user.name "account1"
git config user.email "your_email1@example.com"
```
For Account 2:
```bash
git config user.name "account2"
git config user.email "your_email2@example.com"
```
## ‚úÖ Step 5: Test Which SSH Key Is in Use (Optional)
To check which SSH key is being used:

For Acount 1:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# You should see:
# Hi account1! You've successfully authenticated...
```

For Acount 2:

```bash
ssh -T git@github-account2
# You should see:
# Hi account2! You've successfully authenticated...
```

This confirms the correct SSH key is in use.

## üåü Conclusion
You now have separate SSH keys configured for two GitHub accounts. By using different aliases in the SSH configuration, you can easily manage multiple GitHub accounts on the same machine. Always remember to use the correct SSH alias when cloning repositories and pushing changes!
